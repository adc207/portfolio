      <h2>MIAX Exchange Internship</h2>
      <p>During my internship with MIAX Exchange Group, I contributed to a trading systems development team where I worked on a TOM (Top of Market) application. My main responsibility was to build a system that took in the Best Bid and Offer (BBO) values after trade matching and broadcast them to other exchanges. This required careful handling of market data protocols and working closely with C++ systems to maintain ultra-low latency. I collaborated with previous interns' matching engine code and built atop it in a modular, efficient way.</p>

        <h3>Why I Build</h3>
        <p>Every line of code I write is a chance to improve how we solve problems. I enjoy understanding systems and creating tools that are actually used — whether in a trading engine or a puzzle game.</p>

        <h3>Lessons from MIAX</h3>
        <p>Working at MIAX taught me the real-world importance of performance and clarity. Comments, naming conventions, and communication with senior engineers were just as important as code that ran efficiently.</p>
